# GenFive

# Product Vision

GenFive simulates a battle between you and your party against an assortment of monsters using the Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Ruleset. It will track your Health, Spells, and Skills, along with those of the enemy. It will also include the option to create your own characters for use in the battle simulator.
There is always a demand for fun games available to be played over the internet, especially during a pandemic. Many groups are no longer able to meet up in person, so there is a need for online tools to assist players in recreating the in-person experience. 
While there are other products that individually offer the services our product will, none of them offer the complete package. Roll20 offers online battlemaps and lets players roll attacks, but you canâ€™t directly affect another character's health, abilities, or give items. Our product is also completely free, and does not require purchasing of any additional rulesets.
