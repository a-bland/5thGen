This assignment consists of two stages:

Stage 1: You are to establish a GitHub page for your group project. Each team should have a single page, and all members should be able to commit files. Your GitHub page should include all project documents. Group members should be making commits to these documents on a regular basis. By looking at the commit history, I should be able to see who has been contributing to the group.

Stage 2: In addition to establishing your repository, you will need to commit your project proposal - a vision statement. This vision statement will need to include the following information:

What will the product do?
Why are you creating this particular product?
Who will benefit from this product?
How does the product compare against similar products already on the market?
You should frame this vision statement in terms of an elevator pitch:

For ... (the productâ€™s target market)
Who/That ... (describe what need your product solves)
The product ... (product name,or product category)
That leads to ... (main advantage, appealing reason for purchase)
Unlike the ... (principal competing alternatives)
Our product offers ... (describe main differentiation)
 

You will receive 1 point for an accessible GitHub repository and 1 point for each of the six parts of an elevator pitch in your proposal. If your GitHub repository is not accessible, you will receive 0 points.

 

Your submission should be a link to your GitHub repository.
